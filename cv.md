# About Me

Started learning the basics of layout and programming in 2021. There were difficulties with understanding JavaScript. At that point, I decided to take a break to see if I needed to do it. At the end of 2022, I thought I would continue to study. In 2023, I participated in a project, doing layout and a bit of JavaScript. At the moment I'm studying Vue.js, making projects for my portfolio.
